This is a social media app. We created this app for a university project.

Instructions for use:

When running the code the user is faced with a question of whether they like
to log in or register.

Register is used to create a new account of a player or an athlete and sets unique credentials to them in order to log in the next
time they use our service.

Log in is used when a user already have an account and wants to enter our service.

Based on the type of user (Coach/ Athlete) the rest of the application is different.
